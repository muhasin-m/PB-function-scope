# Function Scope




#### 1. Print Exponential Values
* In the file `index.js` write a function called `printExponentialValues` that accepts two numbers as parameters
* It should calulate a series of exponential numbers where the first argument is the base number for the calculation and the second argument designates how many numbers should be generated
* The function should print the resulting series of numbers to the terminal as a single string separated by space
* If one or both of the passed arguments are not a number, the message `"x or y is not a number"` should be printed to the terminal 
* For example if we have function(3, 5) The function should print `3 9 27 81 243` (Prints 5 exponential values of 3)
* function(2, 8) prints `2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256` (Prints 8 exponential values of 2)

#### 2. Fruits
* Create a function named `printFavoriteFruit`. Declare a variable called `fruit` outside of the function and store your favorite fruit as a value. Reassign the variable within the function and print "My favorite fruit is: _x_". 

#### 3. Multiply a Number by Itself
* Create a function named `exponent` that takes two numbers as parameters. The second parameter defines how many times the first number should be multiplied by itself. Save the output in a variable named `result` and print it from inside the function. 
* Then, try to access the variable `result` outside of the `exponent` function. Is this possible? Why/Why not? Comment your answer in the `index.js` file.
